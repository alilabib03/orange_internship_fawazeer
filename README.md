This is a java based project that uses spring boot as the frame work to simplify the development of the application. This "Fawazeer" project aims at developing the backend component that checks Orange customer's eligibility for getting a certain gift by addressing the API for this project with a get request having as a parameter the unique identifier of the customer. Then after the use of the client-server model concept, we manage to return a response that indicates whether the customer is eligible for the promo (specifically the gift) or not. The project definitely depends on the existance of a database that we use to retrieve and update customer's info.Postgres was used as the relational DBMS.
